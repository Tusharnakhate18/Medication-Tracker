# Medication tracker for old age people
It help us to remind daily exercise and routine also indicate medicine time.
## Getting Started

You need Apache, MySQL and PHP and phpgraphlib for the graphs. Once this are setup you can just copy the files to the web server folder. run the schema.sql to create the database and change the details in both dbconnect.php as well as the graphlib.php 

I haven't yet got around to running the graphs from the same dbconnect.php file.
